# Doom-Nukem

## Description
Go to the top speed ! Continuation of the Wolf3D, the Doom Nukem pushes the possibilities of Raycasting much further while bringing a dimension of Game design, you will therefore have to make a real game and for that it is a mixture of Doom and Duke Nukem 3D that you will have to realize! Many basic functional elements are the same. However, they were not implemented in the same way by the designers of the two games. It's up to you to find the one that suits you and that will allow you to add the requested features as those you want to see.
