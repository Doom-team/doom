#  VANILLA  (plain DOOM.EXE or HERETIC.EXE etc...)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# NOTE:
#      Vanilla means the engine (EXE) which came with the game.
#
#      Hence it is not a real port, but a fake port which supports
#      all games, and is handled specially in the Eureka code.
#
#      Don't add anything to this file!
