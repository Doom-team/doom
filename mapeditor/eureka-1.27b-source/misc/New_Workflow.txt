WORKFLOW DIFFERENCES TO YADEX
-----------------------------

(TODO: move this stuff to documentation)

1. can "draw" linedefs in VERTEX mode by pressing SPACE.
   
   can start in a blank spot or highlight a vertex to start at.
   
   after first vertex is selected, press SPACE again in a blank
   spot to add a new vertex and a new linedef to that vertex.

   can continue doing this until pressing SPACE on an existing
   vertex, which will finish the line drawing.  If the last line
   creates a loop, a new sector will be added as well.

2. can insert a vertex on an orange highlighted linedef, causing
   that linedef to be split by the new vertex.

3. can drag a vertex onto an orange highlighted linedef and that
   linedef is automatically split by the dragged vertex.

4. can delete a vertex which is connected to TWO linedefs and
   those linedefs are merged into one.

5. can drag a vertex onto an existing vertex and the two vertices
   are automatically merged into one.

   plus, if the two vertices were the opposite ends of a linedef
   then that linedef is automatically deleted.

6. can split a sector by just adding one or more linedefs from
   one side of the sector to the another.

7. in SECTOR mode, can position the mouse pointer inside an 
   sectorless area and press SPACE to insert a new sector.
 
8. in SECTOR mode, the SPACE key will "correct" an existing sector
   (which currently must be highlighted when pressing SPACE).
