Editing:

+  improved drag behavior, never modify the current selection

+  select/copy/paste textures in the 3D view

+  an operation menu, bound to F1 key or CTRL-RMB

+  undo/redo: show what was undone in the status area

-  improved ability to highlight/select very short linedefs

-  entering a negative "Length" in Linedef panel moves the start
   vertex of the line instead of the end vertex


General:

   building all nodes no longer resets the undo/redo history,
   more preference settings, ability to disable GL nodes,
   and support for ZDoom uncompressed node format (XNOD)

+  support TX_START/TX_END textures, including PNG and TGA format

-  find sprites outside of S_START/S_END (except in vanilla)

Key System:

+  mouse buttons (and wheel) use the key binding system

+  smooth navigation for the 2D and 3D views

-  allow key bindings to override hard-coded menu shortcuts

-  use F1..F10 function keys for various menu shortcuts

Bugs Fixed:

+  fixed problem of unable to split lines close to an end-point

-  fixed problem of deleting a loop of linedefs inside another
   sector could sometimes delete that outer sector too

-  fixed unwanted rail texture when splitting a sector and the
   texture name began with '_' or '#' (such as "_WALL").

-  fixed inaccurate criss-cross linedef detection
-  fixed rendering of unpegged lowers under sky ceilings
-  fixed textures in Linedef panel not updating after undo or redo
-  fixed exporting to keep the iwad/port/resources of target wad
