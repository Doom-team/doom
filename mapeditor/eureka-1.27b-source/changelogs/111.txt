CHANGES Eureka 1.11
===================

(Changes since 1.07 version)


Games and Ports:

+  Hexen support!
   (thanks to printz for doing some of the heavy lifting)

+  Boom generalized lines and sectors

+  treat Freedoom Phase 1 and Phase 2 as separate games

+  added Eternity port definition, thanks to printz

-  Heretic: categorized the textures and flats
-  changed default port from Boom --> Vanilla


Editing:

+  rendering of sector flats/lighting in the 2D window

+  easier vertex "drawing mode" using the LMB

+  when adding lines, automatically split crossed lines

-  inserting a vertex with SHIFT continues the drawing mode
-  inserting a vertex with CTRL inhibits creation of sectors

-  SHIFT + LMB in sectors mode always opens a selection box
-  better merging of linedefs when dragging a vertex
-  prevent overlapping lines when deleting 3rd vertex of a triangle

-  much less chance to accidentally drag an object
-  when a line splits a sector, use a consistent orientation
-  when creating a fresh map, add all four player starts
-  allow loading a map with no vertices, no linedefs (etc)


UI:

+  fixed texture warping in 3D preview

-  sector panel: buttons for quickly setting the headroom
-  sector panel: MMB on the ceiling flat sets it to sky
-  right-click on a sidedef or sector texture sets it to default
-  various layout tweaks to the editing panels

-  added "Recent Textures" command (etc) to Browser menu
-  fixed RECENT category to show most recent items at the top
-  status bar lets you see full message via a tooltip


Commands:

-  new "Last Selection" command, undo an accidental clearing
-  added /reverse flag for CopyProperties command
-  extended LIN_Flip command, avoid making lines with no right side


Map checking:

-  find "dangling" vertices
-  detect the Medusa Effect on 2S lines
-  detect transparent tex on solid walls

-  find manual doors on 1S lines
-  don't consider teleport things to be stuck in monsters
-  ability to SHOW unused vertices


Miscellaneous:

-  improved eureka.desktop file, courtesy Fabian Greffrath
-  have a fallback sprite for the MBF dog thing (id 888)
-  replaced "Aspect ratio" with "Pixel aspect ratio" in prefs
-  use absolute paths for resource filenames in __EUREKA lump
